# Deliveries Localization
This repository includes localization files for Deliveries, a package tracker for iOS and Mac.

If you're interested in localizing Deliveries for a new language, let us know first. It's a lot of work to maintain supported languages over time, so even if you're willing to do the translations we may not be able to add it to the app.

The file `rules.json` is used to process the XLIFF files generated by Xcode, removing strings that do not need to be translated. It's for our use—you can ignore it.
